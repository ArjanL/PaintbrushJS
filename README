PaintbrushJS is a lightweight, browser-based image processing library 
that can apply various visual filters to images within a web page.

You use it by applying a class to an element on the page and setting 
a few parameters with some extra HTML attributes. If the element is
an img or it has a background-image set in your CSS, PaintbrushJS 
will create a temporary canvas element and manipulate the image 
there, before finally saving it back out to the original element.
